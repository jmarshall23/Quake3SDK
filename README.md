Quake 3 SDK
   * The depot includes the GPL source code(modified, vm code is removed Quake 3 DLL's are now loaded by default and have proper function pointers).
   * Editor compiles and runs and integrated into the solution.
   * All SDK related files are included(map source that was included in the original point release for the 3 maps in the demo), and freshly compiled with the tools.
   * The Quake 3 DEMO files are in the baseq3.
Everything that you need for starting from the Quake 3 source should be right here.
